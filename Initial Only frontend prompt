You are a senior frontend developer.  
Build a **responsive web application** called **Pledge Point** (frontend-only, no database integration for now).  

📌 Tech:
- Use React + TailwindCSS (or default Vibe stack).
- Keep design minimal, clean, gamified (cards, icons, emojis, progress bars).
- Mobile-first responsive layout.

📌 Pages & Flow:
1. **Welcome Screen**
   - Title: "✨ Welcome to Pledge Point"
   - Subtitle: "Turn your words into actions. Build trust, stay accountable, and earn rewards for keeping your promises."
   - Button: [ Get Started ]

2. **Disclaimer & Terms**
   - Text box with:
     - “This app is for personal, social, and professional accountability.”
     - “Promises are not legally binding.”
     - “Users are fully responsible for their commitments and rewards.”
   - Button: [ Agree & Continue ]

3. **Choose Promise Type Page**
   - Heading: "What kind of promise would you like to create today?"
   - Promise type options as large buttons/cards with icons:
     - 🤝 Self-Promise (personal goals, habits, streaks)
     - 💕 Couple Promise (partner commitments, shared accountability)
     - 👯 Friend Promise (fun bets, events, outings)
     - 👨‍👩‍👧 Family Promise (chores, study, bonding time)
     - 💼 Professional Promise (tasks, deadlines, team goals)

4. **Create Promise Form**
   - Inputs:
     - Promise Title
     - Details (textarea)
     - Deadline / Frequency (date picker / dropdown)
     - Points / Penalty (number input)
     - Proof Upload (optional file input)
   - Button: [ Save Promise ]

5. **Tracker Dashboard (after saving)**
   - Show created promise in a **card layout** with:
     - Title & details
     - Daily Check-in buttons (✔️ Kept / ❌ Broken)
     - Streak Counter (🔥 Streak: X days)
     - Progress Bar (% completion of goal)
     - Points Earned
   - For Couple/Friend/Family promises, add:
     - Dual Check-in or Parent Approval (extra ✔️ button for second user/parent)
     - Notes/Comments section
   - Reminder toggle (On/Off)

6. **Gamification Layer**
   - Leaderboard section (dummy static for now)
   - Rewards section (locked icons / "Coming Soon")
   - Promise History log (list of past promises with ✔️/❌/⭐ emojis)

📌 Additional Notes:
- Use **cards, progress bars, badges, and emoji-based UI** to make it fun & engaging.
- No backend yet → just keep state in local storage or frontend memory.
- Make the UI **modular** so database and authentication can be plugged in later.
